var: Variables declared with var are function-scoped, which means they are only accessible within the function in which they are defined. If a variable declared with var is defined within a function, it is not accessible outside that function.

let and const: Variables declared with let and const are block-scoped. This means they are confined to the block (a set of curly braces {}) in which they are defined, whether it's within a function, loop, or any other block. They are not accessible outside of that block.

<p>

null is a value that represents the intentional absence of any object value or value itself. It is typically used when you want to explicitly indicate that a variable or property should have no value or no reference.



undefined is a value that represents an uninitialized, missing, or non-existent value. It is often the default value of variables in JavaScript until they are assigned a value.

Stateless: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store any client state between requests.

Resource-Based: Resources, such as data objects or services, are identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Resources can be manipulated using standard HTTP methods like GET (retrieve data), POST (create data), PUT (update data), and DELETE (remove data).

Representation: Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON, XML, HTML, or others. Clients can request a specific representation, and servers can respond with the appropriate format.

Client-Server: The client and server are separate entities that communicate over a network. This separation allows for scalability, as the client and server can evolve independently.

Layered System: A client may not be aware of all the intermediaries, such as proxies or load balancers, that exist between it and the server. This layered architecture improves flexibility and scalability.
